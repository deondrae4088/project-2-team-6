### *Purpose of Use*   
* The primary goal of our project, Golden State Housing Insights, is to predict housing prices in the state of California. Our team aims to achieve this by leveraging machine learning models to analyze various factors, including investor return on investment (ROI), affordability, distance between homes and cities, and specific home features. By integrating these elements, we strive to provide accurate and actionable insights into the California housing market, aiding investors, homebuyers, and policymakers in making informed decisions.

## Data Pre-Processing and Machine Learning Steps
* Housing Price Prediction using Zillow Data Analysis
  * Our team employed a comprehensive data pre-processing approach to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our housing price predictions. We utilized powerful libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib was used for visualizing data trends and patterns. We also applied data melting techniques to reshape our datasets, making them more suitable for analysis. Additionally, we incorporated time series analysis to account for temporal trends and seasonality in housing prices. This robust pre-processing framework enabled us to prepare our data effectively for machine learning modeling.

  * Our team conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the housing data. This initial step allowed us to gain valuable insights and informed our subsequent modeling approach. We employed both ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Auto-ARIMA models to predict housing prices. The ARIMA model helped us understand the temporal dependencies and trends in the data, while the Auto-ARIMA model automated the process of identifying the optimal parameters for our time series forecasting. By comparing the results from these models, we were able to enhance the accuracy and robustness of our housing price predictions.

## Visuals and Explanations
* To effectively depict our data, we utilized a variety of visualizations, including line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps. Line graphs were employed to illustrate trends over time, while bar charts provided a clear comparison of categorical data. Scatter plots helped us identify correlations between different variables, and heatmaps offered a comprehensive view of data density and relationships. We finalized our data display by presenting these visualizations in Google Slides for easy sharing and collaboration, and in Streamlit for an interactive and dynamic user experience. These visual tools enabled us to communicate our findings clearly and effectively to our audience.
